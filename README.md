## Readings

`Read by` dates for readings are the dates on which the content will be discussed in class, or is part of individual and team tests. Required readings are prefixed with a number to indicate the suggested order of reading (for logical flow, not as an indication of importance). Optional readings are prefixed with `OPT`. They are not required reading and are not part of the tests. They typically contain additional information that may be useful for particular assignments.
