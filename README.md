## Readings

`Read by` dates for readings are the dates on which the content will be discussed in class, or is part of individual and team tests. Required readings are prefixed with a number to indicate the suggested order of reading (for logical flow, not as an indication of importance). Optional readings are prefixed with `OPT`. They are not required reading and are not part of the tests. They typically contain additional information that may be useful for particular assignments.

## Assignments

All assignments are due on the listed due date at the specified time (see [syllabus](https://2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/syllabus) for policy on late submissions). Unless otherwise indicated, the assignments are completed on GitHub as described in the instructional videos for the first few assignments. The type of assignment (individual vs. team) as well as links to the relevant video tutorial (if applicable) and to start the assignment are posted below. Some assignments may be solely in preparation for a later team activity and may not be graded themselves. All information on submission and grading is provided in the individual assignments' `README.md`. While all major individual and team assignments are already listed, please be aware that several smaller ones that are specifically in preparation for in class exercises will likely be added in between.
