# Schedule

This is the schedule for the Fall 2017 **Introduction to Geomicrobiology** class at the University of Colorado Boulder. The class takes place MWF 10:00-10:50 in BESC 1B75. The most up-to-date version of this document is available online at [2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule](https://2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule). Details on readings and assignments will be filled in throughout the semester and **the exact schedule for the modules may change as we go along**. For details on the syllabus see [2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/syllabus](https://2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/syllabus).

## Topics

Individual and team readiness tests (iRAT/tRAT) ***always*** take place on the first day of a new module (e.g. on August 28 for Module 1 and on September 4 for Module 2).

## Readings

`Read by` dates for readings are the dates on which related assignments are due (`Assignment`), content will be part of a team exercise or discussion in class (`Activity`), or is part of individual and team readiness assessment tests (`RAT`). Required readings are prefixed with a number to indicate the suggested order of reading (for logical flow, not as an indication of importance). Optional readings are prefixed with `OPT`. They are not required reading and are **not** part of any tests or exercises but provide additional information that you may find helpful or interesting.

## Materials

The following table is a summary of the online materials that are part of the exercises or activity assignments (the ones that are required class preparation are also listed in the [Readings](#readings) section). PDFs and other non-online materials are located in the [Google Drive](https://goo.gl/QePQxE) / activities folder (for activities) and the [Google Drive](https://goo.gl/QePQxE) / presentations folder (for presentations).

## Assignments

All assignments are due on the listed due date at the specified time (see [syllabus](https://2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/syllabus) for policy on late submissions). The `type` of assignment (individual vs. team) as well as details on `how to` do the assignment are posted below. Some assignments may be solely in preparation for a later team activity and may not be graded themselves. While the names of all major out-of-class assignments are already listed, please be aware that several smaller ones that are specifically in preparation for in-class exercises will likely be added in between.

Details on how to do each assignment will be posted as the assignments become available throughout the semester. Most assignments will be completed on GitHub and will list a link to `Start Assignment` once they become available, as well as additional links to relevant video tutorials (if applicable). All information on submission and grading will be provided in the individual assignments' `README.md` files. If this sounds confusing, do not worry, all of this will be explained in detail in the first few tutorial videos which will introduce how to create a GitHub account, accept individual and team assignments, collaborate on team assignments, complete and submit assignments for grading, etc.
